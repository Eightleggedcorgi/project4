# Creature Teacher

## Description
Who didn't want the perfect website for cataloguing and learning about their favorite animals and all the other ones? That's right, nobody! With Creature Teacher all the world's knowledge is at your fingertips.

## Brief Example
Create entries for any animal and view them in the index, add custom descriptions, classifications, and even images.

## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to easily navigate the site to anywhere I want to be, and preferably also backtrack without mashing the back button every time
* As a user, I expect the program to run without a hitch and do everything it says it can do
* As a user, the design should be user-friendly and most importantly intuitive, to navigate and hopefully also to use
* As a user, I expect the website to not bombard me with ads constantly if it's going to be this simple, because otherwise that would just be lame

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Python Django
* PostgreSQL
* Python .venv (and pip to install it)
* Microsoft Azure
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL

## Installation Instructions
Fork and clone the repo, and you may have to add your own PostgreSQL database or at least make one with the same name of "creature2". Might also have to make your own superuser and admin login info for Django.
